## Step by step examples of migration phases from a Monolithic Java Ear Application to Microservices 

1) The monolitich 

The example has an EAR file deployed as a one unit of work based on JPA, EJB and JAX-RS.

A long time ago, J2EE and especially application servers were considered to be too bloated and “heavyweight.” 
It could be quite tedious and discouraging for developers to use that technology for developing applications. 
But since the name change to Java EE, that assumption is not true anymore. 

This session shows the benefits of developing against a well-established standard, what makes a framework “lightweight,”
 and what a lightweight yet comprehensive solution for enterprise application could look like. 
 
 Most of the time will be spent live-coding and comparing different approaches and scenarios, 
 including building and deploying applications—on SaaS such as Oracle Cloud or on-premises.
